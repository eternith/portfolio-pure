          <h3>Hey there, I'm Peter.</h3>
          <p>
            I’m an Experience Designer. I strive to bridge technology with design in order to bring value to everyday people. My technical background, enriched by design thinking, allows me to play a key role in creating holistic products and services.
            <br /><br />
            I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science because I was entranced by the possibilities of technology. My aha moment came when I discovered User Experience Design as a way to give direction and purpose to the technology that surrounds us. From then onward, I embarked on the path to becoming an interdisciplinary designer. 
            <br /><br />
            By taking the logical problem-solving mindset I’ve always had and fusing it with an empathetic human-centered process, I’ve developed a superpower that helps me focus technology on addressing human needs, rather than making another superfluous gadget.
            <br/><br />
            While I have a sharp eye for pixel perfection, my real passion is in analyzing the needs of people and businesses so I can design more effective and user-friendly processes for digital products and services. This flexibility helps me shift focus from the big picture to implementation details and everything in between.
            <br /><br />
            I’m always up for expanding my horizons and learning new concepts. Feel free to reach out to me on social media!
